            Provision of the Central Operations Platform (COP) is from Borders
            Systems and the Digital, Data and Technology directorate, both of
            which are part of the Home Office.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            The data controller for COP is Border Force – a data controller
            determines how and why personal data can be processed. You can
            request our Data Protection Impact Assessment and Data Management
            Policy from the COP team.

            Under the Data Protection Act 2018, we are processing this
            information on a performance-of-a-public-task basis to allow you
            to conduct your duties as a Border Force employee. We are also

            COP uses cookies and you cannot access COP from a non-Home Office
            device.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            Cookies allow COP administrators to understand how the platform is
            used, in order to improve the service—for example identifying the
            time period when the service is used least so that updates to it
            can be pushed out at these times; or streamlining how pages are
            accessed based on how users click through the site.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            By continuing to use the service, you are agreeing to the use of
            cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in the
            policy. At the time of writing, all cookies used by COP are
            essential to the use of the service and you cannot opt out of
            them.

            COP uses both persistent and session Matomo cookies. The two types
            of persistent cookies are:
          </p>
          <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              _pk_id: used to store a few details about you such as the unique
              visitor ID, stored for 13 months; and
            </li>
            <li>
              _pk_ref: used to store information to initially identify you
              when you visit the website, stored for 6 months.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="govuk-body">The two types of session cookies are:</p>
          <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>_pk_hsr (heatmap and session recording); and</li>
            <li>
              _pk_ses: used to temporarily store data for the visit and are
              stored for 30 minutes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            A user can remove cookies by deleting them from the browser. This
            can be done by clicking Ctrl+H and navigating to the option to
            clear history, of which cookies can usually be found as a subset.
          </p>
          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Why we need this data</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We use cookie information to enable you to log into the service
            that we provide and to link information you add into COP to your
            account.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We use the information you provide to help ensure that we can
            enforce access control and keep data secure.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We use information about your email and your name that we hold
            within the system when we send you a notification. We use the
            GOV.UK Notify service, to send you notifications from COP to your
            Home Office email address; this service is operated and assured by
            the Cabinet Office.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            The legal basis for processing your personal data is for the
            performance of a public task and under contract. Privacy and
            Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) require either the
            subscriber’s or the user’s consent. In the case that the employer
            is the subscriber and the employee the user, consent from the
            employer is reasonable if the use of the service is necessary for
            the employee to fulfil their duties.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We use a service called Matomo to collect information about how
            you use the COP. We do this to help make sure that the site is
            meeting the needs of its users and help us to make improvements to
            the site and service that we provide.
          </p>
          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">What we do with your data</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            The data we collect may be shared with supplier organisations,
            other government departments, agencies and public bodies, but only
            when there is an appropriate Border Force business need that will
            be facilitated by sharing this data. For example, we will share
            some information with Home Office Performance and Reporting
            Analytics Unit (PRAU) for MI Reporting.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">We will not:</p>
          <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
            <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We will share your data if we are required to do so by law—for
            example, by court order—or to prevent fraud or other crime.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            Information captured via cookies within Matomo includes a unique
            visitor ID, information to initially identify a user when a
            website is visited, analytical information and session data
            temporarily stored for the visit.
          </p>
          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">How long we keep your data</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as:

          </ul>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data
            for the time you are a member of Border Force and then for a
            maximum of 5 years after you leave the Force.

            We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data
            is as safe as possible while it is being processed or stored. We
            store your data on an assured platform within the UK.
          </p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            We use GOV.UK Notify, a service provided by Cabinet Office to send
            you notifications about the COP. Any information included in the
            notification email or SMS is stored in Notify for a maximum of 7
            days; this is stored within the European Economic Area (EEA).

            secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent
            unauthorised access or disclosure of your data—for example, we
            protect your data using varying levels of encryption.

            We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep
