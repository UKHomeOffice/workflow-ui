          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about these systems accessibility</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">Home Office is committed to making our internal systems accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
          <p className="govuk-body">
            Some of our internal systems are either partially compliant or are not compliant with the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>
            , due to the non-compliances and exceptions listed below.

          <p className="govuk-body">
            Some of our internal systems are not compliant with the

          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Non accessible content</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">Some people may find parts of our internal systems difficult to use because:</p>
          <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the design cannot be overridden by personal settings for colours and fonts</li>
            <li>the design does not adapt effectively to changes in the window size or level of zoom</li>
            <li>there are parts that are difficult or impossible to understand or use with a screen reader</li>
            <li>there are parts that are difficult or impossible to reach or use without a mouse or by touching the screen</li>
            <li>the text is not written in plain English</li>
            <li>the design is confusing or inconsistent</li>
            <li>audio/video elements may not have captions, transcripts, signing or audio description</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="govuk-body">These issues mean that our internal systems may not meet some WCAG 2.1 success criteria.</p>
          <p className="govuk-body">We are working on identifying and resolving as many of these issues as soon as possible. As we do this we will publish accessibility statements for separate systems.</p>

          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Disproportionate burden</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">We have not yet identified internal systems where it would be a disproportionate burden on the Home Office to resolve the non-compliance. If this is the case with some of our internal systems, we will publish full details explaining our decision.</p>

          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">

          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">How we tested</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">Some of our internal systems have had more testing than others. Testing has been conducted by Home Office staff and by contracted agencies. Where they have been checked for compliance, it has been against WCAG 2.0 AA and more recently WCAG 2.1 AA. We also increasingly test for compatibility and usability with assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

          <h2 className="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
          <p className="govuk-body">We are reviewing our approach and working towards meeting the regulations by:</p>
          <ul className="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>developing our accessibility capability across the department</li>
            <li>building teams to test for accessibility issues and recommend fixes to suppliers and delivery teams</li>
            <li>continuing to train our staff to create accessible internal systems</li>
            <li>increasing the use of automated and manual accessibility testing in our development process</li>
            <li>continuing to conduct user research with people who have access needs</li>
            <li>putting in place alternative arrangements for those who need them and where feasible making additional adjustments if these are not enough</li>
            <li>putting in place stronger measures to make accessibility a key part of our procurement processes and contracts</li>
